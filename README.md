# Signup-Login-Form-with-Validation

## Description

This project provides a clean and modern signup/login form for web applications.  Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and validation, it offers a seamless user experience.  The form includes fields for name, username, email, and password, and employs JavaScript to validate user input before submission.  This ensures that data is in the correct format and meets specific criteria (e.g., email format, password strength).  The form also provides links for password recovery and easy navigation between signup and login sections.
